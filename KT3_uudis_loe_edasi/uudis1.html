    <h1>WARNS OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS</h1>
    <div class="uudis1-txt">Microsoft's threat intelligence division on Wednesday assessed that a subgroup of the Iranian threat actor
        tracked as Phosphorus is conducting ransomware attacks as a "form of moonlighting" for personal gain.

        The tech giant, which is monitoring the activity cluster under the moniker DEV-0270 (aka Nemesis Kitten), said
        it's operated by a company that functions under the public aliases Secnerd and Lifeweb, citing infrastructure
        overlaps between the group and the two organizations. 

        "DEV-0270 leverages exploits for high-severity vulnerabilities to gain access to devices and is known for the
        early adoption of newly disclosed vulnerabilities," Microsoft said. <br><br>

        "DEV-0270 also extensively uses living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBINs) throughout the attack chain for discovery
        and credential access. This extends to its abuse of the built-in BitLocker tool to encrypt files on compromised
        devices."

        The use of BitLocker and DiskCryptor by Iranian actors for opportunistic ransomware attacks came to light
        earlier this May, when Secureworks disclosed a set of intrusions mounted by a threat group it tracks under the
        name Cobalt Mirage with ties to Phosphorus (aka Cobalt Illusion) and TunnelVision.</div>
