    <div class="uudis3-txt">Cybersecurity researchers have exposed new connections between a widely used pay-per-install (PPI) malware
        service known as PrivateLoader and another PPI platform offered by a cybercriminal actor dubbed ruzki. 

        "The threat actor ruzki (aka les0k, zhigalsz) advertises their PPI service on underground Russian-speaking
        forums and their Telegram channels under the name ruzki or zhigalsz since at least May 2021," SEKOIA said. 

        The cybersecurity firm said its investigations into the twin services led it to conclude that PrivateLoader is
        the proprietary loader of the ruzki PPI malware service. 

        PrivateLoader, as the name implies, functions as a C++-based loader to download and deploy additional malicious
        payloads on infected Windows hosts. It's primarily distributed through SEO-optimized websites that claim to
        provide cracked software. <br><br>

        Although it was first documented earlier this February by Intel471, it's said to have been put to use starting
        as early as May 2021. 

        Some of the most common commodity malware families propagated through PrivateLoader include Redline Stealer,
        Socelars, Raccoon Stealer, Vidar, Tofsee, Amadey, DanaBot, and ransomware strains Djvu and STOP. 

        A May 2022 analysis from Trend Micro uncovered the malware distributing a framework called NetDooka. A follow-up
        report from BitSight late last month found significant infections in India and Brazil as of July 2022. 

        A new change spotted by SEKOIA is the use of VK.com documents service to host the malicious payloads as opposed
        to Discord, a shift likely motivated by increased monitoring of the platform's content delivery network.</div>
